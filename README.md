Differences from the Original.js original (the code from the video) and the script.ts (or script.js, potato potato) is not much, but still there.
when i ported the code from the original folder to the script.ts, a bunch of items needed to be defined as a number or be explicitly told that a variable was not null.
one interesting thing i saw would be that i had to change a bunch of .innerText to .textContext.
one thing i did notice was that everytime i compiled, VS code would flag a bunch of code saying it was duplicated code in the script.js, though that might be due to inexperience.
the code does still work, though the duplicate error stuff is still present for me.
